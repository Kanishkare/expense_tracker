# Add Three Charts to Expense Tracker Dashboard

## Tasks to Complete

- [x] Update dashboard.html: Add three chart containers (monthly spending line chart, category spending pie chart, income vs expense bar chart) with year/month selectors, keeping chart sizes small.

- [x] Test the application: Run, verify the three new charts display correctly with data.
